# friend-finder
Friend Finder is an app that asks you questions and matches you up with someone else who answered similarly. 

## How it works
To get started, enter your name and add a URL for your picture. Answer 10 questions on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and click on submit when you're done. You'll immediately see the name and picture of the person that we matched you with.
